## About Me 🚀
🎓 I’m an **Open-Source enthusiast** & a first year student pursuing my Bachelors in electronics and communications engineering. </br>
👨‍💻  I am passionate about web-developement(both front-end and back-end) and still learning and exploring new languages/fields. </br>
🌱 Currently in my exploration stage, highly ambitious, and a real hard-worker for something of my interest.

## My Experiences 🙌
- I am a mentee at [JGEC Winter of code 2k20](jwoc2k20.tech), which is a coding event organised for students to plunge into Open Source contribution and get the realm of Software Development, and managed to get 4 successful pull requests merged under a few beginner-friendly projects.
